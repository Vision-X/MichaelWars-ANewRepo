              <li>Spent some time on an existing codepen to mangle layouts and clean them up.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>

          <p>
          Flexbox was a topic I was extremely rusty with to the point I needed to relearn the basics.
          Having watched a new video that explained the topic in a similar, but different way, than previously
          provided materials really helped give me a different angle of insight. Seeing a live coding exercise
          in the video definitely helped me re-familiarize myself with the basics before taking it to my PLAY time
          where I really flew through flexbox froggy and into a codepen where I made hilarious and regrettable
          changes to the layout - thankfully I did not save this castastrophe of "design" but I DID become very
          comfortable with and brushed up on my flexbox principles.
          <br>
          Setting the stage absolutely helped me to stay on task. A phone alert did get my attention for a brief moment
          however I was able to deal with that quickly and put my phone face down in order to not see any visual cues
          from its alert.</p>

          <h3>Play</h3>

          <p>Once my express server was setup and postman/nodemon were actively updating the environment I went into building my own array of Objects of all my dog's nicknames, and ranked them in order of cuteness.
          Allowed for several changes to my routes; I wanted to serve up different parts of this Object to postman. Struggled to access the key:value pairs meaningfully.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>

          <p>This was my first introduction to actually getting hands-on creation/deployment of a server (Express in this case). As its conceptually an easy flow to follow, the difficulty really came in getting the json file built out and loaded with the needed dependencies. Once that was built the app.js file was realtively easy to populate. I did enjoy being able to get this built and sandbox deployed in less than an hour and that responding to requests was a very achievable goal in this time block of learning. Setting the stage made my focus clear, writing down my learning objectives before starting kept me on a pointed path, and having time to play really brought it all home.

          I will look to spend more time handling more spohisticated pathing and looking to get into the array of OBjects to serve more meaningful data with ease.</p>

          <p>Took the time to build some complex objects, where some keys had values of arrays (of Objects). Spent considerable time playing with dot and bracket notation to suss out which was the best approach to accessing regular data vs complex (array/obj) data with the original Object.
          -Used Object.assign() to smash multiple Objects together to form a massive hilarious mega Object
          -Used a constructor function to create a template for a Pet object, and then built New Pet() object instances using the constructor

          <h3>Reflection</h3>

          <p>I had some experience with objects, but spending more time diving into best practices and use-cases for each way to create an Object. Beyond that, truly accessing the arrays within the objects was a really great exercise in navigating through and retrieving the values I wanted. I feel much more comfortable knowing the path to accessing the values of these arrays within objects.

          By far the big takeaway from this learning session was getting familiar with Object methods such as Object.keys, Object.values, Object,assign.... and also using FOR...IN loops on Objects. Being able to join to Objects together could prove useful and would have been awkward to scrub around the documentation to follow this topic. Subtle nuace to these methods and what they can do (and also their limitations) has given me a sharper eye for how to proceed forward with these more difficult Object mutations.</p>
