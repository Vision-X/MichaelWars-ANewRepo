        <h2>SMART Goal Setting<h2>
        <p>Write 2 - 5 goals you want to achieve today. At the end of the day, reflect in writing on your progress toward meeting your goals.</p>

        <h3>Goals...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Begin FS-1 Set Goals and Reflect
          <li>Complete FS-2 Reading Comprehension
          <li>Begin Learning to Learn
          <li>Attend a MeetUp tonight

        <h3>Reflections...</h3>

        <p>As of this writing I am completing the first goal, boom! I completed and submitted the FS-2 drills today, I made time for them between 2pm and 3pm. Started learn to learn this morning before I set these goals, but I need to complete a deliverable. I should have been more specific about my short term goals so they would be more measurable than just "start the thing".

        Finally, I did attend my first meetup since [g70] kicked off and I enjoyed it. There was a lot to learn, free pizza and beer, and some good conversations which are archived in my meetup reflections.

        What worked: Smaller, specific tasks were completed. Knowing what needed to be done for the day and realtive order of importance.

        What didnt work: Being vague/generic with my 4th goal. Not allocating the right amount of time to truly break by goals down so they could fit into my schedule.

        Ways to improve: More specifcity as far as actionable steps to achieve the goal (less generics). Writing estimated time blocks for each goal and how that might fit into my daily schedule.

        Overall: Keep on keepin' on, goal setting daily will help me reach my larger goals!</p>

        <h3>Goals...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete FS-1b, goal setting and reflections (today)
          <li>Learn to Learn
            <br>
            a) Complete blog post #1
            <br>
            b) Incorporate/describe first two steps of learning process
          <li>Begin TS1 - Review Learning materials, begin drill version-1
          <li>Attend emberJS meetup / complete writeup & reflection (tonight)

        <h3>Reflections...</h3>

        <p>
        As of this writing I am completing the first goal. Easy! Learn to learn blog post #1 is under construction however I have to find a working version of OBS that is stable for my OSX version (10.9.5). I should have that submitted tomorrow morning.
        I did not get to begin drill version-1 for TS-1 however I did review the learning materials. Finally, the meetup was great and I was able to get a nuanced introduction into how emberJS is being used with graphQL over at Ibotta!

        What worked: Setting the appropriate number of goals for the day. Subdividing gave me a clearer picture of what I needed to do in smaller, more actionable steps.

        What didn't work: Forecasting and accounting for time spent doing things not on my list, such as helping folks out in my cohort. I also was not as efficient or productive as I wouldve hoped to have been so I want to improve on being more firm in my commitment to completing my daily gaols.

        Ways to improve: Take some notes after I complete each goal (what worked/didnt work) and how to improve my approach to smaller tasks (think constant refinement). I should also focus more on my one hour pomodoros to sprint through an objective(s) for that current goal.

        Overall: Work smarter, not harder. Find room to be more optimal in my planning and usage of time in the execution of those plans. :)</p>

        <h3>Goals...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn to learn (complete blog post #1, OBS working version, push and submit by EOD)
          <li>Begin TS-1 drill version-1 and submit by EOD
          <li>If there is time, delve into TS-2 version-2 as well.
          <li>Should I have extra time, spend it on L2L topic 2 to learn and prep blog post shell.


        <h3>Reflections...</h3>

        <p>As of writing this, I was able to accomplish goals 1, 2, 3, with initial planning for my 4th goal.

        What worked: Being more descript in my goal/subtasks and setting expectations for when I would make a submission. Generally, just laying out my plan of attack and MAKING THE TIME to do them was really effective.

        What didn't work: EOD time frame, while it worked, did not truly forecast the time it would take for each goal. Perhaps it did work in a sense, but it did leave me working later into the night to achieve the self-imposed EOD deadline.

        Ways to improve: Setting a hard cut-off time for each day so that the nebulus 'EOD' deadline, while semi-effective, doesn't have the opportunity to cut into personal time which could extend late into the night. I want to take some additonal notes on how effective my approach/forecasting was for each goal that day and also unanswered/additional questions I may have from that session.

        Overall: Very productive day and it felt great to set my course, stick to it, and get my submissions in by EOD.</p>

        <h2>Topic: Flexbox</h2>

        <time>Date: 10/26/2017</time>

        <h3>Set the Stage</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Setting the stage included setting my phone and alerts to off.
            <li>Closed all tabs and programs not involved with this topic/material
            <li>Break down the task, set a time block and a timer, get my LEARN ON!
          </ol>

        <h3>Play</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Spent some time on an existing codepen to mangle layouts and clean them up.
            <li>Spent 20 minutes engaged with a flex-box game called Flexbox Froggy
          </ol>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
        Flexbox was a topic I was extremely rusty with to the point I needed to relearn the basics.
        Having watched a new video that explained the topic in a similar, but different way, than previously
        provided materials really helped give me a different angle of insight. Seeing a live coding exercise
        in the video definitely helped me re-familiarize myself with the basics before taking it to my PLAY time
        where I really flew through flexbox froggy and into a codepen where I made hilarious and regrettable
        changes to the layout - thankfully I did not save this castastrophe of "design" but I DID become very
        comfortable with and brushed up on my flexbox principles.
        <br>
        Setting the stage absolutely helped me to stay on task. A phone alert did get my attention for a brief moment
        however I was able to deal with that quickly and put my phone face down in order to not see any visual cues
        from its alert.</p>

        <h2>Topic: Express servers</h2>

        <time>Date 11/16/17</time>

        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>

        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15_aFqZS2x7rJvrYjY0QdF5TJA_fzlAca/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/15_aFqZS2x7rJvrYjY0QdF5TJA_fzlAca/view?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Setting the stage included setting my phone and alerts to off.</li>
            <li>Closed all tabs and programs not involved with this topic/material</li>
            <li>Break down the task, set a time block and a timer, get my LEARN ON!</li>
            <li> Objectives: a) Explain what express is b) run an express server c) respond to requests</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Play</h3>

        <p>Once my express server was setup and postman/nodemon were actively updating the environment I went into building my own array of Objects of all my dog's nicknames, and ranked them in order of cuteness.
        Allowed for several changes to my routes; I wanted to serve up different parts of this Object to postman. Struggled to access the key:value pairs meaningfully.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>This was my first introduction to actually getting hands-on creation/deployment of a server (Express in this case). As its conceptually an easy flow to follow, the difficulty really came in getting the json file built out and loaded with the needed dependencies. Once that was built the app.js file was realtively easy to populate. I did enjoy being able to get this built and sandbox deployed in less than an hour and that responding to requests was a very achievable goal in this time block of learning. Setting the stage made my focus clear, writing down my learning objectives before starting kept me on a pointed path, and having time to play really brought it all home.

        I will look to spend more time handling more spohisticated pathing and looking to get into the array of OBjects to serve more meaningful data with ease.</p>

        <h2>Topic: Objects in JavaScript</h2>

        <time>Date 11/17/17</time>

        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>

        <img src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kAf5PLXO410nFprJA3ZexH04AEPxHuqb/view?usp=sharing"/>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Setting the stage included setting my phone and alerts to off.</li>
            <li>Closed all tabs and programs not involved with this topic/material</li>
            <li>Break down the task, set a time block and a timer, get my LEARN ON!</li>
            <li> a) Basic principles of an object b) Creating them c) Accessing data in Objects d) Object methods (just a few - not ALL of them)
            Play</li>
          </ol>
        </p>


        <p>Took the time to build some complex objects, where some keys had values of arrays (of Objects). Spent considerable time playing with dot and bracket notation to suss out which was the best approach to accessing regular data vs complex (array/obj) data with the original Object.
        -Used Object.assign() to smash multiple Objects together to form a massive hilarious mega Object
        -Used a constructor function to create a template for a Pet object, and then built New Pet() object instances using the constructor

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>I had some experience with objects, but spending more time diving into best practices and use-cases for each way to create an Object. Beyond that, truly accessing the arrays within the objects was a really great exercise in navigating through and retrieving the values I wanted. I feel much more comfortable knowing the path to accessing the values of these arrays within objects.

        By far the big takeaway from this learning session was getting familiar with Object methods such as Object.keys, Object.values, Object,assign.... and also using FOR...IN loops on Objects. Being able to join to Objects together could prove useful and would have been awkward to scrub around the documentation to follow this topic. Subtle nuace to these methods and what they can do (and also their limitations) has given me a sharper eye for how to proceed forward with these more difficult Object mutations.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>James, Turing Grad, worked on an iClicker replacement for college in-class quizzing. Open source, free, and works well. Just requires sharing a link.</li>

              <li>Guillermo, Galvanize grad, works for Volt. Emphasized how important it is to show up to meetups and events to get your face out there
              and how this can get the attention of attending employers and translate to potential job opportunities. Make a point to meet one new person at every one you attend.</li>

              <li>Ike, Galvanize grad. Dylan, Galvanize grad.</li>

        <h3>[g70] attendees: </h3>
            <p>BJ, Brian N, Michael, Kevin, Carolyn, Bryan, Ben, James ...</p>

            <br>

        <h2>TOPIC: CSS Variables</h2>

          <p>Custom properties aka Variables -already exist in preprocessors like SASS, Less, Stylus) *mostly supported already

            <ul>how variables work:
              <li>-assign with :root { --variableName: value; }</li>
              <li>.myClass { color: var(--variableName);</li>
              <li>backgroundcolor: rgb(var(--differentName),0,0)</li>
              <li>height: calc(var(--differentName) * 1px);</li>
              <li> box-shadow: var(--somethingElse);</li>
              <li>Window.getComputedStyle(el, null).getPropertyValue("--variable").trim();</li>
              <li>Document.documentElement.style.setProperty(--value)</li>

            <h3>Why use CSS Variables?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>no need for a preprocessor like SASS</li>
                <li>variables are static</li>
                <li>variables cascade</li>
                <li>browser repaints when the value changes</li>
                <li>can be manipulated with JS!</li>
              </ul>


        <h2>TOPIC: Chrome Dev Tools 201</h2>
            <ul>(Chrome 60 release - 61 is the most recent) Covering:
              <li>Autocomplete with array access</li>
              <li>enhanced console code</li>
              <li>node debugger</li>
              <li>step into</li>
              <li>conditional breakpoints</li>
              <li>advanced tricks</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Notes:</h3>

            <p>Object dot notation normally: docuemnt.head.childNodes[0] [ now autocompletes dot notation ]
            <br>
            Array autocompletion for bracket notation
            <br>
            classes[key]
            <br>
            Writing functions in console: now auto indents and goes to the next line for you!
            <br>
            Refactoring code in the console: cmd+d allows refactoring on the fly
            <br>
            Node Debugger: node --inspect-brk async.js
            <br>
            -allows you to debug in chrome and stops at first point to allow custom breakpoints
            <br>
            -provides you a link and you can drop it in chrome and debug... OR -use the dev tools open when you run the command... and it loads your code into the console/debugger in chrome
            <br>
            -step into... jump around and stop code execution (hold CMD to highlight to jump to for break points)
            <br>
            -green highlights are async locations to jump to
            <br>
            -Condtional breakpoints... ->Pause on caught exceptions - stops at a spot before the error is thrown
            <br>
            -More conditional breakpoints... ->Right click on the spot you want, you can add a conditional break point
            <br>
            -More more on conditional breakpoints... ->add on the fly stiff to trace through your code in ways to help debugging

        <h2>Speaker: Megan Cooney - Platform engineer at Ibotta</h2>

        <h3>Topic: GraphQL & Ember</h3>

        <p>What? ITs a query language for you API GraphQL lets to replace multiple REST requests with a SINGLE CALL to fetch the date you specify

        Ex... Might take multiple calls to get what you need.</p>

        <p>Why? Facebook mobile app wanted specific information to stop using mobile web views for almost everything Was looking for something different, which is where graphQl comes in.

        Github has similar reasons, JSON api calls to get the needed info was wayyyy to frequent or contained extra info with every call that you didnt need</p>

        <p>How to setup GraphQL

        Schema :
          -define object types
          -can be queried
          -can be deprecated

        Resolvers :
          -How you query actually returns data (or use Graphcool to get up and running with just your schema!)</p>

        <p>Two big concepts...
          <br>

          Query:
          <br>
          -request the object and the fields
          -can pass arguments to the query, i.e. pagination, number requested
          -can get back type info via __typename

          Mutation:
          <br>

          -pass variables and return an object

          Authenteication:

          -GraphQL is not opinionated</p>


          <p>Advantages of GraphQL...
            -determine if query is valid via types
            -A grand buffet of data (this can be a disadvantage as well)

            GraphQL Client Advantages...
            -Apollo Client:
              -Big advantage is caching
            -Subscriptions :
              -Can mock things easily
            -Relay:
             -Supported by Facebook
             -Built for Facebook's needs</p>

          <p>GraphQL at Ibotta
            -Splitting the rails Monlith
            -Able to query for user-specific content
            -Moving API interactions for the app to nodeJS GraphQL server
            -Ibotta's ember website uses the old Rails API</p>

          <p>Other Factors... -Only want to make changes to data consumptipn, not the UI -Only wanted to affect certina endpoints

          Success measures? -Delete a ton of code -no loss of functionality -Make showing offers on the web a less confusing process

          Ember Addons:
            -Ember Apollo clients
            -Ember GraphQL adapter</p>

        <h2>Meetup: Denver Develop Happy Hour</h2>
        <time><h3>Date:</h3> 11/14/2017</time>
        <h2>Location: Tap XIV</h2>

        <h2>People I Met</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Eric:
              <p>Currently a C# dominant dev who had a full-stack background. Took on C# as part of his role at his company. Gave me some really great insight in HR processes in larger companies. Some of his advice included...</p>
              <br>
              <p>DONT apply for your dream job first why: If you aren't qualified enough yet... you can run into snags with how much of their resources they have to use on just getting you through an interview process. He mentioned there are friends of his who tried this path and, after rejection and months (or a year) later on re-apply they discovered these larger companies did not want to waste MORE of their resources on you a second time around.
              advice: Really research what job you'd want there, what the stack looks like, and start to really mirror what that is. Also, reach out to current epmloyees, pick their brain as much as they will allow, and really just prepare yourself for a solid effort once you're ready to enter the application process. In the meantime, he suggested landing a first dev gig NOT with your dream job and gain some value, experience, and leverage that when you believe you are truly ready to chase down that dream job.</p>
              </li>
            <li>Alex:
              <p>Works with an obscure stack, Scala was the only thing I recognized.

              We talked a lot about the scene in Denver as he JUST moved here a week ago. While talking about what Galvanize prepares us for, especially in project workflow and team based projects, is that at his company they have an onboarding process for new grads (tradition 4-year CSCI undergrads) where they invest a lot of money and effort to get them up to speed on... project workflow and team based projects! This was REALLY encouraging for me because it told me the skills we are gaining here in a replicated work environment will ultimately allow us to hit the ground running much faster than maybe traditional CSCI grads would, potentially giving us an edge in some corporate hiring processes.</p>
              </li>
          </ul>


        <h3>What I Learned</h3>

        <p>Devs here in Denver are really quite interested in giving guidance/advice to us fledgling devs. Their insight into the industry was extremely valuable to me and I gleaned a lot of information from these conversations that I may have otherwise had to learn the hard way.</p>

        <h3>Questions I Have</h3>

        <p>Who else could speak on some of the things Eric spoke of, and if they can confirm or deny this type of loop-back application process is common enough so, upon beginning the job search, I can employ some calculated choices to craft my direction.

        What do some large company onboarding processes look/feel like for a jr developer?

        What other real-world developer workflow tools or skills could I be adopting early to be more hireable?</p>

        <h3>Final Reflections</h3>

        <p>These meetups are really starting to give me a better picture of the developer community here in Denver. It has been really cool to encounter so many excited individuals that are willing to share their perspective and experiences in a way that I had not anticipated.</p>
