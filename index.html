        <h2>SMART Goal Setting<h2>
        <p>Write 2 - 5 goals you want to achieve today. At the end of the day, reflect in writing on your progress toward meeting your goals.</p>

        <h3>Goals...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Begin FS-1 Set Goals and Reflect
          <li>Complete FS-2 Reading Comprehension
          <li>Begin Learning to Learn
          <li>Attend a MeetUp tonight

        <h3>Reflections...</h3>

        <p>As of this writing I am completing the first goal, boom! I completed and submitted the FS-2 drills today, I made time for them between 2pm and 3pm. Started learn to learn this morning before I set these goals, but I need to complete a deliverable. I should have been more specific about my short term goals so they would be more measurable than just "start the thing".

        Finally, I did attend my first meetup since [g70] kicked off and I enjoyed it. There was a lot to learn, free pizza and beer, and some good conversations which are archived in my meetup reflections.

        What worked: Smaller, specific tasks were completed. Knowing what needed to be done for the day and realtive order of importance.

        What didnt work: Being vague/generic with my 4th goal. Not allocating the right amount of time to truly break by goals down so they could fit into my schedule.

        Ways to improve: More specifcity as far as actionable steps to achieve the goal (less generics). Writing estimated time blocks for each goal and how that might fit into my daily schedule.

        Overall: Keep on keepin' on, goal setting daily will help me reach my larger goals!</p>

          <li>Learn to Learn
            <br>
            a) Complete blog post #1
            <br>
            b) Incorporate/describe first two steps of learning process
          <li>Begin TS1 - Review Learning materials, begin drill version-1
          <li>Attend emberJS meetup / complete writeup & reflection (tonight)

        <h3>Reflections...</h3>

        <p>
        As of this writing I am completing the first goal. Easy! Learn to learn blog post #1 is under construction however I have to find a working version of OBS that is stable for my OSX version (10.9.5). I should have that submitted tomorrow morning.
        I did not get to begin drill version-1 for TS-1 however I did review the learning materials. Finally, the meetup was great and I was able to get a nuanced introduction into how emberJS is being used with graphQL over at Ibotta!

        What worked: Setting the appropriate number of goals for the day. Subdividing gave me a clearer picture of what I needed to do in smaller, more actionable steps.

        What didn't work: Forecasting and accounting for time spent doing things not on my list, such as helping folks out in my cohort. I also was not as efficient or productive as I wouldve hoped to have been so I want to improve on being more firm in my commitment to completing my daily gaols.

        Ways to improve: Take some notes after I complete each goal (what worked/didnt work) and how to improve my approach to smaller tasks (think constant refinement). I should also focus more on my one hour pomodoros to sprint through an objective(s) for that current goal.

        Overall: Work smarter, not harder. Find room to be more optimal in my planning and usage of time in the execution of those plans. :)</p>

        <h3>Goals...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn to learn (complete blog post #1, OBS working version, push and submit by EOD)
          <li>Begin TS-1 drill version-1 and submit by EOD
          <li>If there is time, delve into TS-2 version-2 as well.
          <li>Should I have extra time, spend it on L2L topic 2 to learn and prep blog post shell.


        <h3>Reflections...</h3>

        <p>As of writing this, I was able to accomplish goals 1, 2, 3, with initial planning for my 4th goal.

        What worked: Being more descript in my goal/subtasks and setting expectations for when I would make a submission. Generally, just laying out my plan of attack and MAKING THE TIME to do them was really effective.

        What didn't work: EOD time frame, while it worked, did not truly forecast the time it would take for each goal. Perhaps it did work in a sense, but it did leave me working later into the night to achieve the self-imposed EOD deadline.

        Ways to improve: Setting a hard cut-off time for each day so that the nebulus 'EOD' deadline, while semi-effective, doesn't have the opportunity to cut into personal time which could extend late into the night. I want to take some additonal notes on how effective my approach/forecasting was for each goal that day and also unanswered/additional questions I may have from that session.

        Overall: Very productive day and it felt great to set my course, stick to it, and get my submissions in by EOD.</p>
